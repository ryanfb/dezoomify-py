# dezoomify-py

Dezoomify is a program to reverse the image tiling method that is
used by some websites to display large images in a convenient manner.

## Note about this repository
This is a fork of the (visibly unmaintained) https://sourceforge.net/p/dezoomify
This fork fixes bugs in the original version.

## Docker version

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ryanfb/dezoomify-py/blob/master/Dockerfile)
defines a `/data` volume for storing output, and an `ENTRYPOINT` so that
arguments can be passed in to the dockerized `dezoomify.py` script.

An example of mapping the current working directory to `/data` and downloading
an image with Docker might look like:

    docker run -v $(pwd):/data ryanfb/dezoomify url /data/example.jpg

## Installing

Dezoomify should not require any installation. Simply run

    chmod +x dezoomify.py
    ./dezoomify.py <Zoomify page URL> <output file name>
on Linux or

    py dezoomify.py <Zoomify page URL> <output file name>
on Windows.

If the above does not work for Windows, try reinstalling
Python 3 with the "Add python.exe to search path" option.
